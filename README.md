This repository contains a deep learning project focused on predicting tip amounts in a restaurant dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, building a neural network model, and implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the 'tips' dataset from the seaborn library. It includes information about tips given in a restaurant, including:

Total bill
Tip amount
Gender of the person paying the bill
Whether the person is a smoker
Day of the week
Time of day
Size of the party
Project Steps
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset using seaborn.
Display the first few rows to understand the data structure.
Data Preprocessing:

Convert categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
Separate the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
Model Building:

Build a simple neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model consists of two hidden layers with 32 and 16 neurons respectively, and an output layer.
Model Training:

Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Train the model with 500 epochs and a batch size of 32, using 20% of the training data for validation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Calculate and print the mean absolute error (MAE) on the test set.
Visualization:

Plot the training and validation loss over epochs.
Plot the training and validation mean absolute error over epochs.
Key Results
The model's mean absolute error (MAE) on the test set is displayed.
Training and validation loss and MAE plots are provided to visualize the training process and the effect of early stopping.
